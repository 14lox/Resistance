Resistance
==========

Sample project that implements a table view cell with a sliding content view similar to iOS 7 mail. 

- Each cell has a content view that can be slid to the left, but not to the right.
- Sliding the content view reviews buttons underneath.
- Sliding the content part way will snap it open or shut depending on where it lands.


Enhancements
==========

- Really slow swipes behave better in Mail. Something like looking at the velocity and target when scrolling ends would probably be enough to make that feel better.
